# etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-sketch project by TheOdinProject
Created an n by n grid where n is the number of squares per side of the grid.
When the mouse hovers over the grid, the squares will change color.
A button is placed at the top of the page which will prompt users to key in the number of squares per side of the grid (limit: 100 squares per side), and once keyed in, the current grid will be removed and replaced with the new grid

Restrictions:
1. using CSS flex without using CSS grid
